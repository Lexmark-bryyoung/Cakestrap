Cakestrap
=========

_CakePHP + Bootstrap_

CakePHP version: 2.3.8
Bootstrap version: 3 RC 1

This is intended to allow you to bake a new site using Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com/).

This is **not** a plugin. This is a theme. (http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/views/themes.html).

Installation
------------

If you have a tool like rsync, you can do this:

```
rsync -av /path/to/repo/* /path/to/APP/
```

Otherwise you can manually copy the files like so:

```
copy /View/Themed/Cakestrap into APP/View/Themed/ (you may have to create the Themed folder)
copy /Console/Templates/Cakestrap into APP/Console/Templates/
```
